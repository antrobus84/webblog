<h2><b>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </b></h2><p>Firstly if you want to create a successful digital project you are going to need the right team, for that you will need a leader, someone who’s is smart and great at organising and monitoring people properly in order to make sure work is done efficiently, on time and properly, as well as plan the project appropriately to fit in the roles for each team member and the aim for the project. You will need people with skills within the area they will be working in such as IT knowledge, skills with coordinating with others and if these skills are required for the project.
        You will also need to plan out the risks of your project, its aim and who it is projected to, to efficiently do this it is best to create a kanban or use programs like troll to easily access this online as a team, using a kanban you can create a very organised set of objectives divided into groups for how important they are and the deadline for when they need to be done as well as select specific people to do each job.</p>
