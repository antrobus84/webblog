<h2><b>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</b></h2><p>First of all I will be using trello to plan out the steps to making my website, by doing this I can easily find out what objectives I need to do and which ones are more important or even necessary. Trello is a site used as an online kanban board, to help organise work and help people doing projects in teams to achieve their goal more efficiently and quickly with less frustration, you can use trello to create deadlines on tasks and assign them to certain members of a team so that everyone can know what to do without having to spend time discussing over it.
