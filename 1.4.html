            <h2><b>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</b></h2>
            <p>One of the main reasons projects fail is poor communication in a team and a lack of a leader, or a leader who lacks experience of any form of confidence to speak out when their team is doing something wrong.
                    Poor teamwork can cause projects to slow down or just not happen at all, without communication your team will not be able to organise projects properly and may all be doing the exact same thing at once or even nothing at all and cause frustration and arguments to form.
                    Poor planning can also ruin a project as without a proper plan and scope for the project in mind you wouldn’t know where to start and will have to plan while you create your project causing you to become less efficient and gradually slow down and fail to track progress.
