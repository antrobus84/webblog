            <p>This can differ depending on whether you would have to use native or cross-platform, your employers especially would have a say in what they will want you to use as you may then have to use say Xcode for IOS native development. Personally if I was to be able to choose my own software I would rather pick windows and android as they are more user friendly and much more powerful, native would also be the better choice as while it is more expensive it will have less bugs and be much more responsive and faster then cross-platform would be.
