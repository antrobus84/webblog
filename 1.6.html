                <p>Trello has helped me greatly for my last project while working as a team to create a working IOS app on Xcode, using trello I was able to properly organise my team into doing different things at one time, by being able to organise objectives into different categories of importance we were able to section of what we were doing at that moment, what needed to be done, what could be added but really wasn’t all too important and what has been done as well as archive anything that became clutter and wasn’t really needed. I was also able to use slack to communicate with my team as well as frequently send them work that has been done as well as ask for research and information that was needed to help me finish up the project.
                        GitHub is useful as it allows you to save your current progress using push, this saves all of your current work so if you were to make a mistake and there is too much code to fix you can just delete it and recover your last working code.
