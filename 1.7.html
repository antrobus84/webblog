            <h2><b>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</b></h2>
            <p>There are many different legal restraints which include technology and security audits, inventory management, an annual health check, business technology alignment, financial governance and information governance.
                    GDRP is a regulation that stands for General Data Protection Regulation, they impact businesses and projects by allowing the right to access, the right to be forgotten, the right to data portability, the right to be informed, the right to have information corrected, the right to restrict processing, the right to object and the right to be notified. These will all effect projects in many ways but are there to protect a persons personal information and data.
                    The ways these cause an impact is that they allow you to request access to your personal data and how it is being used, to transfer data from one service provider to another, to stop your data from being processed for direct marketing and to be notified when there is a breach that can compromise and individuals personal data.
