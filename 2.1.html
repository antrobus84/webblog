            <p>The tools I used to create my website I had little difficulties with, where as problems came up they weren’t problem that were very hard to deal with, using Trello I was able to organise myself and my time keeping to ensure I was able to do what I set out to do. I could easily plan everything I wanted to do for my website and map out my ideas into categories of what was most important and what wasn’t.
                Visual Studio Code was very user friendly and I enjoyed using it to make my website, it is very easy to find the code you are looking for online and easy to adapt said code to fit your own style and suit what you are aiming for, even with errors Visual Studio Code will point out your mistakes and where they are so you don’t have to worry about fixing errors until the end, this allowed me the time to lay out my website before going back to polish it up.</p>
