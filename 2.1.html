        2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
</h2>
<p>The tools I used to create my website I had little difficulties with, where as problems came up they weren’t problem that were very hard to deal with, using Trello I was able to organise myself and my time keeping to ensure I was able to do what I set out to do. I could easily plan everything I wanted to do for my website and map out my ideas into categories of what was most important and what wasn’t.
    Visual Studio Code was very user friendly and I enjoyed using it to make my website, it is very easy to find the code you are looking for online and easy to adapt said code to fit your own style and suit what you are aiming for, even with errors Visual Studio Code will point out your mistakes and where they are so you don’t have to worry about fixing errors until the end, this allowed me the time to lay out my website before going back to polish it up.</p>
<h2>
        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
</h2>
<p>For this project I used Slack, Trello and Visual Studio Code, all three came in handy for multiple tasks, Visual Studio Code allowed me to actually build the website while Trello allowed me to plan it out and Slack helped keep communication between other people working on their own websites.
    Visual Studio Code was very handy for the task, being user friendly and rather easy to use with a layout I have quickly become familiar with has made this project that much more enjoyable, with Trello also helping to plan out my website and write down ideas they worked well together. Slack I used to communicate with others on their project and help each other with ideas and inspiration, sharing code as well as thoughts on what to do next.</p>
<h2>
        2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
</h2>
<p>With my website finished I can say the result is a mixture of negative and positive emotions, the overall outcome is positive and looks great, I went for a pixelated design with three pixel artwork gif backgrounds scrolling down as not to repeat the same image, I went for darker colours for a calmer atmosphere with a lot to look at in the background to make the paragraphs feel less boring, while using pinks, blacks and whites to go for a cyber punk style, the font itself was used to fit with the design and overall its great to look at visually and works to sell off my interests. Everything works as it should, links all open new windows where as the navigation bar highlights when scrolled over and stays highlighted when on the page you selected, there is a back to top button on every page that appears when you begin to scroll down and the black box around the text itself is transparent to make sure while you can see the background images the text colour doesn’t blend in. On a more negative side I couldn’t get the background images to properly line up, while they work fine on fullscreen any smaller will begin to space them out creating a white background in-between, this means it will not look as visually appealing on mobile. I could not think of anything more to add within the time frame I was allocated, given more time I would have improved the website more functionally such as add images that link you to pages and a more in-depth about me.</p>
<h2>
    2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
</h2>
<p>Given more time I would have added many more features, I would first of all fix the backgrounds to work in a smaller window and on mobile phone, I would also add better spacing between paragraphs, maybe even create a link for each question and answer separately to make a working Q and A. I would research different blogs and similar websites to gather ideas to use for my own site and fill it out to make it look more professional,  further researching CSS and HTML will also help greatly to allow me to gain a greater a knowledge to apply many more features easily.</p>
