            <p>For this project I used Slack, Trello and Visual Studio Code, all three came in handy for multiple tasks, Visual Studio Code allowed me to actually build the website while Trello allowed me to plan it out and Slack helped keep communication between other people working on their own websites.
                Visual Studio Code was very handy for the task, being user friendly and rather easy to use with a layout I have quickly become familiar with has made this project that much more enjoyable, with Trello also helping to plan out my website and write down ideas they worked well together. Slack I used to communicate with others on their project and help each other with ideas and inspiration, sharing code as well as thoughts on what to do next.</p>
