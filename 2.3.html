            <p>With my website finished I can say the result is a mixture of negative and positive emotions, the overall outcome is positive and looks great, I went for a pixelated design with three pixel artwork gif backgrounds scrolling down as not to repeat the same image, I went for darker colours for a calmer atmosphere with a lot to look at in the background to make the paragraphs feel less boring, while using pinks, blacks and whites to go for a cyber punk style, the font itself was used to fit with the design and overall its great to look at visually and works to sell off my interests. Everything works as it should, links all open new windows where as the navigation bar highlights when scrolled over and stays highlighted when on the page you selected, there is a back to top button on every page that appears when you begin to scroll down and the black box around the text itself is transparent to make sure while you can see the background images the text colour doesn’t blend in. On a more negative side I couldn’t get the background images to properly line up, while they work fine on fullscreen any smaller will begin to space them out creating a white background in-between, this means it will not look as visually appealing on mobile. I could not think of anything more to add within the time frame I was allocated, given more time I would have improved the website more functionally such as add images that link you to pages and a more in-depth about me.</p>
