            <p>For this project I was set goals to reach, one of these goals was outcome 2, 2.1 which was to prepare appropriate content for my site, to do this I have first written out a word document for each question and answer and have looked online for reference material, making sure everything was correct and factual I then decided to lay it out onto my site.
              Another test was outcome 2, 2.6 which was to create error free pages that are fit for purpose, to do this I first had to finish my website, once finished I went over everything on the html itself and in the code through Visual Studio Code. Everything works as it should for a computer and there are no bugs or errors left.
              To make it work for the purpose at hand which is to explain my work and what I have done I also made sure the layout and content themselves fit in the right place, the layout makes the text easy to read and it set out in such a way that you can find it easy to navigate to each point.</p>
