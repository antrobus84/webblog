<h2>
        3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
</h2>
<p>When making my website I had worked alone on the project, after just recently doing a team project developing an app I now have experienced both and understand the pros and cons between the two, the first thing I noticed was how easy and efficient it was to divide the work between members and using slack we could communicate even from a distance and share our work and our progress, where as alone I am burdened with all of the workload and instead have to find ways to organise myself to be able to do as much as I can within the time frame allocated.
        There was a lot to do that a team could have finished within a shorter amount of time, communication is key and having multiple brains behind a single project means a lot of ideas can flow as well as planning, brain storming and problem solving a lot of which you cannot do alone, having a team eases frustration and allows space to breathe without the worry that you may not get everything done.</p>
<h2>
        3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
</h2>
<p>Trello is a good tool to improve productivity in an efficient manner, being able to set targets and timed deadlines for yourself as well as collect and store information and images/links.
        Another good way would be to take breaks every now and then, overworking yourself and running into walls can frustrate and slow you down, taking the time to breathe and think things over can allow you to bypass those walls quicker without as much stress.
        A way I had improved my productivity and efficiency was too communicate with others and share ideas, you don’t have to show your work in order to just throw some ideas around so you wouldn’t have to worry about someone copying your work, sharing code and idea allowed for me to put more into my website and be inspired more frequently.</p>
<h2>
        3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
</h2>
<p>If I was to do a project like this again I would learn more about trello and try to expand it, be more in depth with the information I store on the tool and use screen shots of my work to see where I am up to and have a better understanding of what to do, I could also create more list options to divide the work up further by including ones for links and references as well as have it set as public so others can review my plans.
        Using slack more frequently to share ideas and code would also be another target of improvement I would like to make, opening a channel for questions and answers would improve productivity by allowing everyone to help with the problems each of us would have.
        Team work would be vital, dividing work between members and having a group of people with different talents and ideas would be key to success, by having someone drawing and mapping out the websites designs and layout while someone writes the text and another writes the code with a leader operating to make sure the team flows nicely would cut the time it takes to complete by more then half.</p>
<h2>
        3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
</h2>
<p>By just a single person designing, writing and developing then website the view will be very biased, testing it out yourself would only allow you to judge your own work and without an outside opinion you wouldn’t know what others may like.
        By asking for advice and having someone else test your work and review your website you will be given an unbiased view which would be vital in making vast improvements to your site.
        Another reason for this is the information for ideas and improvements that you can gather, this would help greatly in improving your website and adding additional features as well as knowing if there are any untested errors and spelling mistakes that you may have missed.</p>
