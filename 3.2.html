            <p>Trello is a good tool to improve productivity in an efficient manner, being able to set targets and timed deadlines for yourself as well as collect and store information and images/links.
                    Another good way would be to take breaks every now and then, overworking yourself and running into walls can frustrate and slow you down, taking the time to breathe and think things over can allow you to bypass those walls quicker without as much stress.
                    A way I had improved my productivity and efficiency was too communicate with others and share ideas, you don’t have to show your work in order to just throw some ideas around so you wouldn’t have to worry about someone copying your work, sharing code and idea allowed for me to put more into my website and be inspired more frequently.</p>
