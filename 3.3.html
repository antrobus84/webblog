            <p>If I was to do a project like this again I would learn more about trello and try to expand it, be more in depth with the information I store on the tool and use screen shots of my work to see where I am up to and have a better understanding of what to do, I could also create more list options to divide the work up further by including ones for links and references as well as have it set as public so others can review my plans.
                    Using slack more frequently to share ideas and code would also be another target of improvement I would like to make, opening a channel for questions and answers would improve productivity by allowing everyone to help with the problems each of us would have.
                    Team work would be vital, dividing work between members and having a group of people with different talents and ideas would be key to success, by having someone drawing and mapping out the websites designs and layout while someone writes the text and another writes the code with a leader operating to make sure the team flows nicely would cut the time it takes to complete by more then half.</p>
