            <p>By just a single person designing, writing and developing then website the view will be very biased, testing it out yourself would only allow you to judge your own work and without an outside opinion you wouldn’t know what others may like.
                    By asking for advice and having someone else test your work and review your website you will be given an unbiased view which would be vital in making vast improvements to your site.
                    Another reason for this is the information for ideas and improvements that you can gather, this would help greatly in improving your website and adding additional features as well as knowing if there are any untested errors and spelling mistakes that you may have missed.</p>
