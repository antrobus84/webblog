<h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page 
    </h2>
<p>For my website I have created a pixelated styled design, the background has 3 separate gif images that connect to one another so that it won’t be repetitive and will stay fresh as you scroll down, using gifs background makes the website page feel more lively and vibrant, I have used pixel styled artworks for the gif images and they hardly feature any people to make the site more calming.
        For the text I went for a white coloured pixel arcade style that sits in the centre of the screen inside a black but transparent box, the box is used not just for visual satisfaction but to prevent the white of the text blending in with the background image. The top of the screen features a navigation bar, inside that bar are pink coloured links that links to each separate page, each link highlights when hovered over with a grey background and changes the text to black, when clicked the background of the link stays white and the text black to show the viewer what page they are on.
        The pages you can navigate to are Home, 2.1, 3.1, Unit 2 and Contact Me, each having paragraphs of text of questions and answers while contact me features my email address and phone number.
        For convenience I have creates a “go to top” button that appears whenever you scroll down, the button says “Top” in white text while still keeping the arcade pixel text style with a pink circular rectangle background.</p>

<h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2>
<p>Copyright can affect your website in many different ways, for instance if you were to use an image or maybe a piece of text from an article you would first need to check if it is copyright claimed and if you are able to use it but leave a link to the original site in order to perhaps gain permission from the owner.</p>

<h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
<p>There are many different disabilities out there that can affect a person in many different ways when trying to use the web, but there are many different ways around this too, these disabilities include blindness, low vision, colour blindness, deafness, motor functions and speech.
        The ways we can help people with these conditions are many, for instance with someone who is blind or visually impaired they can use a screen reader, a screen reader which uses a voice synthesiser or braille display to read text or images on the screen to the user, you can also have larger text on your screen so someone who is has impaired sight can still read. For someone who is hard of hearing or deaf you can add subtitles to any videos you may use on your website, use simple and English, for most deaf people English isn’t their first language but sign language might be, try to stick to key information and keep it short, you should also add multiple contact options, just adding a phone number isn’t enough try adding an email address to so you can still be contacted by someone who is deaf.</p>

<h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h2>
<p>There are many different file types usable for websites, including .JPEG, .PNG, .GIF and .TIF.
        .JPEG is one of the most common image formats on the web, it is used to display an image that is compressed using what is called a “lossy”, this means that each time it is saved it loses quality, this loss becomes visible as small blocky elements begin to appear around edges in pictures.
        .PNG and .TIF are other styles of image formats, .PNG doesn’t lose quality in compression and thus can be saved repeatedly , however the file sizes are often quite large. .TIFS is known as the highest quality image format and is best used for commercial print work and shouldn’t be used on the web, the reason for this is the size of the image becomes hard to load so should be exported as a .JPEG instead.
        .GIF is yet another image format that is uniquely able to be animated, they can also be rather small in file size meaning you can upload an animated image onto your website which can draw attention and liven it up a bit.</p>
