<h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
<h2><b>About me<b></h2>
<p>My name is Callum Antrobus, I am 23 and I have tried many different job types and courses to find out what I wanted to do as a career, having been around technology my whole life I realised the answer was in front of me all along, I feel comfortable around a computer and having been accepted into Code Nations 3 week course I have enjoyed every minute so far and would absolutely love to get into the field of IT.
    </p>
    <h2<b>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</b></h2>
        <p>IT has become a very important aspect of business in modern society as companies now rely on IT for communication with customers, efficiency of their operations, security of their information such as banking, documents and customer information and researching new opportunities.
        Using IT companies can create websites to easily connect to their customers on many different levels, whether its to collect information for marketing purposes or if its to connect with them through contact and support or even sell their products in the most efficient and fastest way possible, IT also helps with connecting the many different sites of a single business together whether that’s to communicate with other managers to find out shipment information or to coordinate company matters.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2><b>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </b></h2><p>Firstly if you want to create a successful digital project you are going to need the right team, for that you will need a leader, someone who’s is smart and great at organising and monitoring people properly in order to make sure work is done efficiently, on time and properly, as well as plan the project appropriately to fit in the roles for each team member and the aim for the project. You will need people with skills within the area they will be working in such as IT knowledge, skills with coordinating with others and if these skills are required for the project.
            You will also need to plan out the risks of your project, its aim and who it is projected to, to efficiently do this it is best to create a kanban or use programs like troll to easily access this online as a team, using a kanban you can create a very organised set of objectives divided into groups for how important they are and the deadline for when they need to be done as well as select specific people to do each job.</p>
    <h2><b>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</b></h2><p>First of all I will be using trello to plan out the steps to making my website, by doing this I can easily find out what objectives I need to do and which ones are more important or even necessary. Trello is a site used as an online kanban board, to help organise work and help people doing projects in teams to achieve their goal more efficiently and quickly with less frustration, you can use trello to create deadlines on tasks and assign them to certain members of a team so that everyone can know what to do without having to spend time discussing over it.

            <p>
            This is the link to my trello board which includes the things I need to do in order to begin making my website.
        </p>
        <h2><b>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</b></h2>
        <p>One of the main reasons projects fail is poor communication in a team and a lack of a leader, or a leader who lacks experience of any form of confidence to speak out when their team is doing something wrong.
                Poor teamwork can cause projects to slow down or just not happen at all, without communication your team will not be able to organise projects properly and may all be doing the exact same thing at once or even nothing at all and cause frustration and arguments to form.
                Poor planning can also ruin a project as without a proper plan and scope for the project in mind you wouldn’t know where to start and will have to plan while you create your project causing you to become less efficient and gradually slow down and fail to track progress.

                    <h2><b>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</b></h2>
                    <p>This can differ depending on whether you would have to use native or cross-platform, your employers especially would have a say in what they will want you to use as you may then have to use say Xcode for IOS native development. Personally if I was to be able to choose my own software I would rather pick windows and android as they are more user friendly and much more powerful, native would also be the better choice as while it is more expensive it will have less bugs and be much more responsive and faster then cross-platform would be.
                        </p>
                      <h2><b>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control
                        </b></h2>
                        <p>Trello has helped me greatly for my last project while working as a team to create a working IOS app on Xcode, using trello I was able to properly organise my team into doing different things at one time, by being able to organise objectives into different categories of importance we were able to section of what we were doing at that moment, what needed to be done, what could be added but really wasn’t all too important and what has been done as well as archive anything that became clutter and wasn’t really needed. I was also able to use slack to communicate with my team as well as frequently send them work that has been done as well as ask for research and information that was needed to help me finish up the project.
                                GitHub is useful as it allows you to save your current progress using push, this saves all of your current work so if you were to make a mistake and there is too much code to fix you can just delete it and recover your last working code.
                                </p>
                                <h2><b>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</b></h2>
                                <p>There are many different legal restraints which include technology and security audits, inventory management, an annual health check, business technology alignment, financial governance and information governance.
                                        GDRP is a regulation that stands for General Data Protection Regulation, they impact businesses and projects by allowing the right to access, the right to be forgotten, the right to data portability, the right to be informed, the right to have information corrected, the right to restrict processing, the right to object and the right to be notified. These will all effect projects in many ways but are there to protect a persons personal information and data.
                                        The ways these cause an impact is that they allow you to request access to your personal data and how it is being used, to transfer data from one service provider to another, to stop your data from being processed for direct marketing and to be notified when there is a breach that can compromise and individuals personal data.
