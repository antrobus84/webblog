                    3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
            </h2>
            <p>When making my website I had worked alone on the project, after just recently doing a team project developing an app I now have experienced both and understand the pros and cons between the two, the first thing I noticed was how easy and efficient it was to divide the work between members and using slack we could communicate even from a distance and share our work and our progress, where as alone I am burdened with all of the workload and instead have to find ways to organise myself to be able to do as much as I can within the time frame allocated.
                    There was a lot to do that a team could have finished within a shorter amount of time, communication is key and having multiple brains behind a single project means a lot of ideas can flow as well as planning, brain storming and problem solving a lot of which you cannot do alone, having a team eases frustration and allows space to breathe without the worry that you may not get everything done.</p>
