                    </h2>
                <p>For my website I have created a pixelated styled design, the background has 3 separate gif images that connect to one another so that it won’t be repetitive and will stay fresh as you scroll down, using gifs background makes the website page feel more lively and vibrant, I have used pixel styled artworks for the gif images and they hardly feature any people to make the site more calming.
                        For the text I went for a white coloured pixel arcade style that sits in the centre of the screen inside a black but transparent box, the box is used not just for visual satisfaction but to prevent the white of the text blending in with the background image. The top of the screen features a navigation bar, inside that bar are pink coloured links that links to each separate page, each link highlights when hovered over with a grey background and changes the text to black, when clicked the background of the link stays white and the text black to show the viewer what page they are on.
                        The pages you can navigate to are Home, 2.1, 3.1, Unit 2 and Contact Me, each having paragraphs of text of questions and answers while contact me features my email address and phone number.
                        For convenience I have creates a “go to top” button that appears whenever you scroll down, the button says “Top” in white text while still keeping the arcade pixel text style with a pink circular rectangle background.</p>
