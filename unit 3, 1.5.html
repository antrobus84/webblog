                <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2>
                <p>Copyright can affect your website in many different ways, for instance if you were to use an image or maybe a piece of text from an article you would first need to check if it is copyright claimed and if you are able to use it but leave a link to the original site in order to perhaps gain permission from the owner. In different countries around the word copyright laws can change, from the US having stronger copyright protection laws against logos. in the UK works you have created are protected the second you post them, for instance the second your website is posted it will be copyright protected, however it is still recommended that you register because websites are still subject to abuse and protection would allow for civil cause of action.</p>
