                <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
                <p>There are many different disabilities out there that can affect a person in many different ways when trying to use the web, but there are many different ways around this too, these disabilities include blindness, low vision, colour blindness, deafness, motor functions and speech.
                        The ways we can help people with these conditions are many, for instance with someone who is blind or visually impaired they can use a screen reader, a screen reader which uses a voice synthesiser or braille display to read text or images on the screen to the user, you can also have larger text on your screen so someone who is has impaired sight can still read. For someone who is hard of hearing or deaf you can add subtitles to any videos you may use on your website, use simple and English, for most deaf people English isn’t their first language but sign language might be, try to stick to key information and keep it short, you should also add multiple contact options, just adding a phone number isn’t enough try adding an email address to so you can still be contacted by someone who is deaf.</p>
