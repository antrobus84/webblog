                <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h2>
                <p>There are many different file types usable for websites, including .JPEG, .PNG, .GIF and .TIF.
                        .JPEG is one of the most common image formats on the web, it is used to display an image that is compressed using what is called a “lossy”, this means that each time it is saved it loses quality, this loss becomes visible as small blocky elements begin to appear around edges in pictures.
                        .PNG and .TIF are other styles of image formats, .PNG doesn’t lose quality in compression and thus can be saved repeatedly , however the file sizes are often quite large. .TIFS is known as the highest quality image format and is best used for commercial print work and shouldn’t be used on the web, the reason for this is the size of the image becomes hard to load so should be exported as a .JPEG instead.
                        .GIF is yet another image format that is uniquely able to be animated, they can also be rather small in file size meaning you can upload an animated image onto your website which can draw attention and liven it up a bit.</p>
